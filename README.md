## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript
- [SortableJS](https://sortablejs.github.io/Sortable/) - For drag-and-drop functionality

### What I Learned

During this challenge, I learned how to integrate the SortableJS library to add drag-and-drop functionality to the todo list. This experience also strengthened my understanding of responsive design and managing state in a simple application using vanilla JavaScript.

### Useful Resources

- [SortableJS Documentation](https://sortablejs.github.io/Sortable/) - This helped me understand how to implement drag-and-drop functionality in the todo list.
